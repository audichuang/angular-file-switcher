<!-- Plugin description -->
**Angular File Switcher** is a plugin that switches between similarly named files within a directory. It is
specifically designed for Angular component files but works with any set of files within a directory where file names (
except for the file extensions) match.

I built this as a reaction to Angular CLI QuickSwitch Plugin. While I find it a valuable plugin, it doesn't function
_exactly_ how I want in all circumstances. It has the following enhancements:

* Choose file extensions to include or exclude.
* This plugin works with multiple tab groups how one would expect.
* It doesn't unexpectedly rearrange the tab order.
* Optionally keep files open - by tab group or workspace.
* If you open a similarly named file using a non-file-switcher command (such as Ctrl+Click), you can optionally close
  other similarly named files.
